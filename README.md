# Lucknow Metro Train Guide (LMT Guide)
---
> **Introduction**
>The Lucknow Metro is a Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) being constructed to provide the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh with an environment friendly atmosphere. Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation Limited or LMRC is working on this project which will be an alternative mode of transport since approximately 94% of the city's registered vehicles are private, city had over 2 million registered vehicle in 2015. According to a report every month city is adding about 1000 new four wheelers in its vehicle population. Growing population and huge traffic has called for the transformation of private modes of conveyance to public transport.
> So, I designed this website to facilitate users and provide them with all the information about Lucknow Metro, including timings, fares, and stations. We aim to provide free access to all the information without any charges.
